Aoede is a Discord music bot that **directly** streams from **Spotify to Discord**. The only interface is Spotify itself.

**Note**: a Spotify Premium account is currently required. This is a limitation of librespot, the Spotify library Aoede uses. Facebook logins [are not supported](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/discussions/635).

## 💼 Usecases

- Small servers with friends
- Discord Stages, broadcast music to your audience

## 🏗 Usage

(Images are available for x86 and arm64.)

### Notes:
⚠️ Aoede only supports bot tokens. Providing a user token won't work.

Aoede will appear offline until you join a voice channel it has access to.

### Docker Compose (recommended):

There are a variety of image tags available:
- `:0`: versions >= 0.0.0
- `:0.5`: versions >= 0.5.0 and < 0.6.0
- `:0.5.1`: an exact version specifier
- `:latest`: whatever the latest version is

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  aoede:
    image: codetheweb/aoede
    restart: always
    network_mode: host # needed for initial setup
    volumes:
      - ./aoede:/data
    environment:
      - DISCORD_TOKEN=
      - DISCORD_USER_ID=        # Discord user ID of the user you want Aoede to follow
      - SPOTIFY_BOT_AUTOPLAY=   # Autoplay similar songs when your music ends (true/false)
      - SPOTIFY_DEVICE_NAME=
```

### Docker:
```env
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_USER_ID=
SPOTIFY_BOT_AUTOPLAY=
SPOTIFY_DEVICE_NAME=
```

```bash
docker run --rm -d --env-file .env codetheweb/aoede --net=host
```

### Prebuilt Binaries:

Prebuilt binaries are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/codetheweb/aoede/releases). Download the binary for your platform, then inside a terminal session:

1. There are two options to make configuration values available to Aoede:
	1. Copy the `config.sample.toml` file to `config.toml` and update as necessary.
	2. Use environment variables (see the Docker Compose section above):
		- On Windows, you can use `setx DISCORD_TOKEN my-token`
		- On Linux / macOS, you can use `export DISCORD_TOKEN=my-token`
2. Run the binary:
	- For Linux / macOS, `./platform-latest-aoede` after navigating to the correct directory
	- For Windows, execute `windows-latest-aoede.exe` after navigating to the correct directory

### Building from source:

Requirements:

- automake
- autoconf
- cmake
- libtool
- Rust
- Cargo

Run `cargo build --release`. This will produce a binary in `target/release/aoede`. Set the required environment variables (see the Docker Compose section), then run the binary.

## 🎵 Spotify Authentication

Aoede uses Spotify's zeroconf authentication mechanism. Here's how to authenticate:

1. Start Aoede for the first time. It will print a message with instructions.
2. Open the Spotify desktop app on the same network as Aoede.
3. In the Spotify app, go to "Devices Available" and look for a device named "Aoede" (or your custom device name if set).
4. Click on the Aoede device to connect. This will authenticate Aoede with your Spotify account.
5. Aoede will save the credentials for future use. You only need to do this once.

Once Aoede is running and authenticated:

1. Join a voice channel in Discord.
2. Aoede will automatically join the same channel.
3. Use your Spotify app (desktop, mobile, or web) to control playback.
4. The music will stream directly to your Discord voice channel.
